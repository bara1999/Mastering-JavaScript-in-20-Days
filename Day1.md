# Day 1: Basic JavaScripts
 

## Lesson Summary

### Introduction 
I learned the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is the noun the subject that the sentence is all about, CSS is the adjective, dressing up that noun to make it more attractive, and JavaScript is the verb the interactions and animations on the website. and the places JavaScript can be written, in additon I learned where we can write java script, we can use  browser's JavaScript console, local text files in editors, and online playgrounds.

### DOM
The DOM represents Document Object Model, every HTML element is object,by DOM we can access and update the content, structure, and style of a documen so we can get, change, add, or delete element.

### Values & Data Types
There are 2 kinds of data:
Primitive types (e.g. strings, numbers)
Objects (e.g. document & friends)
we go deep in string and we learnt some of method related to that like length, includes,toLowerCase,startsWith and indexOf.

### Operator
we learnt about :
#### Arithmetic operators
#### Comparison operators
#### Order of operations




## Coding Exercises

### [Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/compound-assignment-with-augmented-multiplication)

#### My Solution


```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

a *= 5;// The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.
b *= 3 ;
c *=10;

```
